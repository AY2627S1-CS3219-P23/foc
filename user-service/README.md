# User Service

Will own accounts, auth, and profiles (User F1–F8): sign-up/OTP, login,
JWT issuance, account update/delete/recover, roles, admin management.
Backlog: issues #84–#98.

Spring Boot 4 · Java 21 · Maven.

Currently: actuator health endpoint, `POST /auth/setup-owner` (creates an
OWNER for any caller with the setup token until
`OWNER_SETUP_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT`, #97), and `GET /users/me` /
`GET /users/{id}` (own and public profile, #95), backed by Postgres via
Spring Data JPA. The root `compose.yaml` runs it with its own `user-db` (host port
`${USER_SERVICE_PORT:-8087}`); `spring-boot:run` needs that database
reachable (`USER_DB_*` env vars). Tests supply their own database.

## Run

```sh
# Tests (need a running Docker daemon: Testcontainers starts Postgres)
./mvnw test

# Run locally
./mvnw spring-boot:run
curl localhost:8080/actuator/health

# Container (from the repo root — build context is the repo root)
docker build -f user-service/Dockerfile .
```
