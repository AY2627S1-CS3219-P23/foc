# credit-service/ — Agent Guide

Java 21 + Spring Boot 4 service for credit balances, reservation,
transfer and history. Read the root `AGENTS.md` first (architecture,
course constraints, AI usage policy). The design authority is
[`docs/credit-service.md`](../docs/credit-service.md): cite its decision
IDs (D1–D12) when touching related code.

## Package map (`src/main/java/foc/credit/`)

| Package | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `config/` | `SecurityConfig`: CORS, health open, everything else needs a valid JWT |
| `security/` | `JwtVerifier` (HS256, shared `JWT_SECRET`), `JwtAuthenticationFilter`, 401/403 problem+json handlers |

No entities, controllers, listener or outbox publisher yet.

## Invariants — do not break

- **Flyway owns the schema** (`db/migration`, `ddl-auto: none`). Change it
  with a new `V<n>__*.sql`, never by editing an applied migration.
- **The schema follows the design doc's "Database" section**: a schema
  change is a design change, so update the doc with it.
- **No shared code except `foc-contracts`** (root `AGENTS.md`, D15). The
  JWT classes are copies of supplier-service's, on purpose.
- **Amounts are integers** (Credit F1.2); balances never go negative
  (`CHECK` constraints back this up).

## Build & test

```sh
(cd ../foc-contracts && ./mvnw install)   # once, before the first build
./mvnw test                               # Testcontainers Postgres: needs Docker
```

The tests run on the `test` profile (`src/test/resources/application-test.yaml`
over the main config) against a real Postgres, so Flyway's V1 runs as in
production.
